# Gauss' Law

## Symmetry

There are three fundamental symmetrires:
- Planar
- Cylindrical
- Spherical

## Electric Flux

The concept of *flux* describes how much of something goes through a given area.

- There is a outward flux through a closed surface containing a positive charge
- There is a negative flux through a closed surface containing a negative charge
- There is no net flux through a closed surface containing no net charge

Formally, it is the dot product of a vector field with an area. Electric flux is represented by the symbol $\Phi$, and its standard units are $\textrm{N}\cdot\textrm{m}^2/\textrm{C}$.

The electric flux of a constant electric field is

$$
\Phi = \vec E\cdot\vec A
$$

where $\vec A$ is the area vector, a vector whose magnitude is the area of the surface and whose direction is $\hat n$, the unit vector normal to the surface.

## Calculating Flux

Flux may be expressed as the continuous sum of the dot product of an electric field over an area.

$$
\Phi=\oint{\vec E\cdot d\vec A}
$$

## Properties of Conductors

- The electric field is zero inside a conductor
- Any excess charge must reside entirely on the surface(s)
