## The Charge Model
- There are two types of charges: positive and negative
- Objects are charged by adding/removing electrons
- Amount of charge $$q = (N_p-N_e)e$$
- Object electrically neutral iff $$q=0$$
- Charge is conserved; it is neither created nor destroyed

## Charge and Electrons
- Charge is quantized; it exists only in discrete (i.e. non-continuous) amounts
- Elementary charge $e$ is the fundamental unit of electric charge
- $e$ is approximately equal to $$1.60217663\times 10^{-19} Coulombs$$
- Charge of any object is an integer multiple of *e*, that is: $$q=ne$$ where $q$ is the total charge, $n$ an integer, and $e$ the elementary charge
- Objects acquire positive charge by loss of electrons; this process is ionization

### Charge Relationships
- Like charges exert repulsive force; opposites exert attractive force
- Force varies directly according to the magnitude of charge
- Force varies inversely according to the distance between charged objects

## Bands
- Bands are closely spaced orbitals approximately indistinguishable in energy level
- Extension of molecular orbital theory; recall HOMO and LUMO

### Valence Band
- The valence band is the highest occupied energy band in a material
- Electrons in the valence band are strongly associated with their individual atoms and are typically involved in bonding 

### Conduction Band
- The conductive band is the lowest unoccupied energy band in a material
- It lies directly above the valence band
- Electrons in the conduction band often are "excited" electrons; through a thermal process, these electrons gain energy and make the jump from the valence band to the conduction band

### Band Gap
- The difference in energy between the valence band and conduction band is the band gap
- The greater the band gap, the less likely electrons are to be found in the conduction band; they lack the energy to make the jump to the conduction band

## Conductivity
- Materials with electrons in the conduction band are good conductors of electricity, because these "free" electrons are able to to move easily through the subtrate
- In highly conductive materials, such as metals, the band gap overlaps; electrons therefore readily jump between the two bands
- Insulators are characterized by a prohibitively large band gap, resulting in an impossibly high amount of energy being required to move electrons into the conduction band to form a current

## Charging
- Charging may occur via direct contact, whereby electrons are directly transferred between a neutral and a charged object

### Charge Transfer by Rubbing
- Rubbing objects breaks intramolecular bonds in otherwise neutral molecules, resulting in the formation of polar ions. 

## Discharging
- Discharging is a process whereby a system is neutralized
- An object may be discharged by direct contact with the ground, into which excess electrons flow

## Polarization
- Polarization is the displacement of charges in an object that remains neutral, resulting in an induced dipole moment
- Polarization is the result of the application of an external electric field

### Electric Dipoles
- The electric dipole is a measure of a system's overall polarity
- It comprises two electric charges of equal magnitude *q* and opposite sign, separated by some distance
- The vector form of the electric dipole moment is expressed as $$\mathbf{p}=q\mathbf{d}$$ where $q$ is the magnitude of the dipole's charge and $\mathbf{d}$ is the vector pointing from the negative charge to the positive charge

## Coulomb's Law
If two charged particles having charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ are separated by distance $r$, the magnitude of the forces they exert on each other is

$$
|F|=F_\textrm{1 on 2}=F_\textrm{2 on 1}=\frac{K|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}
$$

where $K$ is Coulomb's constant. In SI units, $K\approx 8.99\times 10^9\textrm{ N}\cdot\textrm{m}^2/\textrm{C}^2$

- The forces are directed along the line joining the two particles
- Like forces repel, opposites attract
- The forces are attractive for like charges, repulsive for opposite charges

Coulomb's law may be rewritten using the permittivity constant $\epsilon_0$:

$$
F=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}
$$

where $\epsilon_0 = \frac{1}{4\pi K}$.

## Electric Fields
The spatial forces exerted by charges on the objects around them constitute a vector field. The magnitude of the force exerted by an electric field on an object with charge $q$ is

$$\vec F=q\vec E$$

where $\vec E$ is the force per unit charge ratio (in $\textrm{N}/\textrm{C}$) corresponding to

$$
\vec E = \frac{\vec F}{q}
$$

### Electric Field of Point Charges
Given a single point charge $q$, we can calculate its electric field using a probe $q'$:

$$
\vec E = \frac{\vec F_{\textrm{on }q'}}{q'}
$$

- Assuming both charges are positive, the direction of $\vec E$ will be away from $q$.

### Unit Vector Notation
Using a unit vector ($\hat r$), we may rewrite the single point charge field equation (using the permittivity constant) of a source charge $q$ as

$$
\vec E= \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}\hat r
$$

where $\hat r$ points from the charge to the point at which we wish to know the field. If positive, $\hat r$ points away from the point charge $q$ otherwise it points towards $q$.

$$
\vec E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}\hat r
$$

### Line of Charge
$$
\vec E = \left(
    \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{2|\lambda|}{r},

        \textrm{toward if -}
