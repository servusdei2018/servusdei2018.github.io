# Chapter 22 - Electric Charges and Forces

## The Charge Model
- There are two types of charges: positive and negative
- Objects are charged by adding/removing electrons
- Amount of charge $$q = (N_p-N_e)e$$
- Object electrically neutral iff $$q=0$$
- Charge is conserved; it is neither created nor destroyed

## Charge and Electrons
- Charge is quantized; it exists only in discrete (i.e. non-continuous) amounts
- Elementary charge *e* is the fundamental unit of electric charge
- Charge of any object is an integer multiple of *e*, that is: $$q=ne$$ where *q* is the total charge, *n* an integer, and *n* the elementary charge
- Objects acquire positive charge by loss of electrons; this process is ionization

### Charge and Forces
- Like charges exert repulsive force; opposites exert attractive force
- Force varies directly according to the magnitude of charge
- Force varies inversely according to the distance between charged objects

## Bands
- Bands are closely spaced orbitals approximately indistinguishable in energy level
- Extension of molecular orbital theory; recall HOMO and LUMO

### Valence Band
- The valence band is the highest occupied energy band in a material
- Electrons in the valence band are strongly associated with their individual atoms and are typically involved in bonding 

### Conduction Band
- The conductive band is the lowest unoccupied energy band in a material
- It lies directly above the valence band
- Electrons in the conduction band often are "excited" electrons; through a thermal process, these electrons gain energy and make the jump from the valence band to the conduction band

### Band Gap
- The difference in energy between the valence band and conduction band is the band gap
- The greater the band gap, the less likely electrons are to be found in the conduction band; they lack the energy to make the jump to the conduction band

## Conductivity
- Materials with electrons in the conduction band are good conductors of electricity, because these "free" electrons are able to to move easily through the subtrate
- In highly conductive materials, such as metals, the band gap overlaps; electrons therefore readily jump between the two bands
- Insulators are characterized by a prohibitively large band gap, resulting in an impossibly high amount of energy being required to move electrons into the conduction band to form a current

## Charging
- Charging may occur via direct contact, whereby electrons are directly transferred between a neutral and a charged object

## Discharging
- Discharging is a process whereby a system is neutralized
- An object may be discharged by direct contact with the ground, into which excess electrons flow

## Polarization
- Polarization is the displacement of charges in an object that remains neutral, resulting in an induced dipole moment
- Polarization is the result of the application of an external electric field

### Electric Dipoles
- The electric dipole is a measure of a system's overall polarity
- It is represented by two electric charges of equal magnitude  *q* and opposite sign, separated by some distance
- The vector form of the electric dipole moment is expressed as $$\mathbf{p}=q\mathbf{d}$$ where *q* is the magnitude of the dipole's charge and **d** is the vector pointing from the negative charge to the positive charge
