# Chapter 22 - Electric Charges and Forces

## The Charge Model
- There are two types of charges: positive and negative
- Objects are charged by adding/removing electrons
- Amount of charge $$q = (N_p-N_e)e$$
- Object electrically neutral iff $$q=0$$
- Charge is conserved; it is neither created nor destroyed

## Charge and Ions
- Charge is quantized; it exists only in discrete (not continuous) amounts
- Elementary charge $e$ is the fundamental unit of electric charge
- Charge of any object is an integer multiple of *q*, that is: $$q=ne$$ where *q* is the total charge, *n* an integer, and *n* the elementary charge.
