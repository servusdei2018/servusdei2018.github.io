# Electric Potential

Electric potential *energy* is measured in Joules ($J$). Electric potential is measured in volts ($V$).

Similarly to gravitational potential energy, electric potential energy.

## Review - Gravitational Potential Energy

Recall that

$$
\Delta E_{mechanical} = \Delta K + \Delta U
$$

where $\Delta K$ is kinetic energy and $\Delta U$ is potential energy.

$$
\Delta U = -W
$$

The work done by gravity is

$$
W=\vec F\cdot\vec d = mgd\cos{\theta}
$$

where $m$ is mass, $g$ is the gravitational constant, $d$ is displacement, and $\theta$ is the angle between the direction of the gravitational field and the direction of displacement.

This yields the equation for gravitational *potential energy*

$$
\Delta U_{mechanical}=mgh
$$

## Electric Potential Energy

In an uniform electric field, we similarly have

$$
W=\vec F\cdot\vec d=qE\Delta s\cos{\theta}
$$

where $q$ is the particle's charge, $E$ the magnitude of the electric field, and $s$ the displacement of the charged particle according to the direction of the electric field.

This yields the equation for electrical *potential energy*

$$
U_{electric}=qE\Delta s
$$

And the equation for electrical *potential*

$$
\Delta V=-E\cdot\Delta s
$$

- Moving with the field lowers electric *potential*
- Voltage units are volts. $1V=\frac{J}{C}=\frac{N\cdot m}{C}$
- **Voltage is electric potential**

## Voltage of a Constant $\vec E$ field

Not only is

$$
\Delta V = \frac{\Delta U}{q}
$$

but also the voltage may be found via the electric field:

$$
\Delta V = -\int_{r_i}^{r_f}{\vec E\cdot dr}
$$

Hence, from the voltage, the electric field may be integrated:

$$
\vec E = -\left(\frac{dV}{dx}\hat i +\frac{dV}{dy}\hat j + \frac{dV}{dz}\hat k \right)
$$

## Point Charge Potential

The voltage of a point charge with charge $q$ is

$$
\Delta V = \frac{kq}{r}
$$

Recall that the magnitude of the E-field of a point charge is

$$
\vec E = \frac{kq}{r^2}
$$

and that the force between two point charges is

$$
|F|=\frac{k|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}
$$

## Voltage of a Charged Particle within a Uniform $\vec E$ field

$$
\Delta V = qE\Delta s
$$

for charge $q$ in the uniform electric field $E$ where $\Delta s$ is measured from the negative plate.

## Electric Potential Energy of Two Point Charges

The electric potential energy of two charges is

$$
U_{electric} = \frac{kq_1q_2}{r}
$$

where $r$ is the distance between the charges.
