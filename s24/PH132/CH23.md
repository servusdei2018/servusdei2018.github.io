# Electric Fields

## Unit Vector Notation
Using a unit vector ($\hat r$), we may rewrite the single point charge field equation (using the permittivity constant) of a source charge $q$ as

$$
\vec E= \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}\hat r
$$

where $\hat r$ points from the charge to the point at which we wish to know the field. If positive, $\hat r$ points away from the point charge $q$ otherwise it points towards $q$.

## Electric Field Models

### Point Charge (Coulomb's Law)
$$
\vec E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}\hat r
$$

or just the magnitude:
$$
\vec E = \frac{kq}{r^2}
$$

### Line of Charge
$$
\vec E = \left(
    \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{2|\lambda|}{r},
    \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
        \textrm{away if +}\\
        \textrm{toward if -}
    \end{array}\right.
\right)
$$

where $\lambda$ = $\frac{q}{l}$ for some length $l$. Its units are $\frac{\textrm{C}}{\textrm{m}}$.

### Plane of Charge
$$
\vec E = \left(
    \frac{\eta}{2\epsilon_0},
    \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
        \textrm{away if +}\\
        \textrm{toward if -}
    \end{array}\right.
\right)
$$

where $\eta$ = $\frac{q}{A}$ for some area $A$. Its units are $\frac{\textrm{C}}{\textrm{m}^2}$.

### Sphere of Charge
$$
\vec E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{Q}{r^2}\hat r
$$

## Electric Fields of Dipoles
We may represent an electric dipole with two opposite charges $\pm q$ separated by a small distance $s$.

$$
(E_{dipole})_y \approx \frac{2kqs}{y^3}
$$

gives the energy field of a dipole along the axis of the dipole, bisecting s. This only applies for $y\gg s$.

## Electric Field Lines
- Lines start on positive charges and end on negative charges
- The closer together lines are, the greater the field strength
- Lines never cross
