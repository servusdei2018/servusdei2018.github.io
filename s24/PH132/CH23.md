# Electric Fields

## Unit Vector Notation
Using a unit vector ($\hat r$), we may rewrite the single point charge field equation (using the permittivity constant) of a source charge $q$ as

$$
\vec E= \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}\hat r
$$

where $\hat r$ points from the charge to the point at which we wish to know the field. If positive, $\hat r$ points away from the point charge $q$ otherwise it points towards $q$.

## Electric Field Models

### Point Charge (Coulomb's Law)
$$
\vec E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}\hat r
$$

or just the magnitude:
$$
\vec E = \frac{kq}{r^2}
$$

### Line of Charge
$$
\vec E = \left(
    \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{2|\lambda|}{r},
    \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
        \textrm{away if +}\\
        \textrm{toward if -}
    \end{array}\right.
\right)
$$

where $\lambda$ = $\frac{q}{l}$ for some length $l$. Its units are $\frac{\textrm{C}}{\textrm{m}}$.

### Plane of Charge
$$
\vec E = \left(
    \frac{\eta}{2\epsilon_0},
    \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
        \textrm{away if +}\\
        \textrm{toward if -}
    \end{array}\right.
\right)
$$

where $\eta$ = $\frac{q}{A}$ for some area $A$. Its units are $\frac{\textrm{C}}{\textrm{m}^2}$.

### Sphere of Charge
$$
\vec E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{Q}{r^2}\hat r
$$

## Electric Fields of Dipoles
We may represent an electric dipole with two opposite charges $\pm q$ separated by a small distance $s$.

$$
(E_{dipole})_y \approx \frac{2kqs}{y^3}
$$

gives the energy field of a dipole along the axis of the dipole, bisecting s. This only applies for $y\gg s$.

## Electric Field Lines
- Lines start on positive charges and end on negative charges
- The closer together lines are, the greater the field strength
- Lines never cross

## Charge Densities

The linear charge density $\lambda$ for an object of length $L$ and total charge $Q$ is defined as

$$
\lambda = \frac{Q}{L}
$$

whose units are in $\frac{\textrm{C}}{\textrm{m}}$.

The surface charge density $\eta$ for an object with area $A$ and total charge $Q$ is defined as

$$
\eta = \frac{Q}{A}
$$

whose units are $\frac{\textrm{C}}{\textrm{m}^2}$

## Electric Fields of Continuous Charge Distributions

### Rod

For a rod of length $L$ and total charge $Q$, the electric field strength $E_{rod}$ at distance $r$ from the center of the charged rod is

$$
E_{rod}=\frac{k|Q|}{r\sqrt{r^2+(L/2)^2}}
$$

- Suppose $r\gg L$, the rod's electric field is the same as a point charge.

### Infinite Rod

If the rod becomes very long *line of charge* while $\lambda$ remains constant,

$$
E_{line}=\frac{2k|\lambda|}{r}=\frac{2kQ}{Lr}
$$

### Ring

For a ring of radius $R$ and total charge $Q$, the electric field strength $E_{ring}$ at distance $z$ on the ring's axis is

$$
E_{ring}=\frac{kzQ}{(z^2+R^2)^{3/2}}
$$
