# Sources of Electric Potential

An electric potential difference is created by separating positive and negative charges.

## Batteries

Batteries "lift" positive charges from the negative terminal to the positive terminal.

The work done to lift one charge is the EMF (electro motive force) whose units are volts:

$$
\epsilon = \frac{W_{chemical\ reactions}}{q}
$$

In ideal batteries, $\Delta V = \epsilon$ but in reality, $\Delta V < \epsilon$ however the difference is so small that in most cases, batteries may be considered ideal.

A battery may be represented by two parallel lines, one of which (the positive side) is longer than the other.

## Capacitors

A capacitor is any two separated charged conductors. It may be represented by two parallel lines of equal length.

A pair of electrodes charged with $\pm Q$ has a net charge of $0$ but there exists a potential difference $V_{cap}$ between the electrodes such that

$$
Q = CV_{cap}
$$

where $C$ is capacitance. The SI unit of capacitance is the Farad, and $1F = 1\frac{C}{V}$.

## Equivalent Capacitance

Capacitors may be linked in parallel or in series. Capacitors thereby linked together may be represented by a single equivalent capacitance, or $C_{eq}$.

In parallel,

$$
C_{eq} = C_1 + C_2 + \cdots
$$

And in series,

$$
\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_1}+\frac{1}{C_2}+\cdots
$$
