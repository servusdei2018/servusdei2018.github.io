# Current

Current is the rate of flow of charge; the amount of charge that passes per unit time.

#### Macroscopic View of Current

$$
I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}
$$

Its units are amperes $1A = \frac{C}{s}$.

- The current points from high to low voltage; that is, it points in the same direction as the $\vec E$ field

#### Microscopic View of Current

$$
I = \eta Av_de
$$

where $\eta$ is charge carrier density, $A$ is a cross sectional area, $v_d$ is electron drift velocity, and e is the elementary charge $1.6\times 10^{-19}C$

Charge carrier density $\eta$ has units $\frac{\mathrm{Number\ of\ Charges}}{m^3}$.

## Current Density

#### Macroscopic View

Current $J$ is equal to

$$
J = \frac{I}{A}
$$

where $I$ is current and $A$ is a cross sectional area.

#### Microscopic View

Current $J$ is equal to

$$
J = \eta v_de
$$

where $\eta$ is charge carrier density, $v_d$ is electron drift velocity, and $e$ the elementary charge $1.6\times 10^{-19}C$.

## Kirchoff's Junction Rule (Node Equation)

$$
I_{in}=I_{out}
$$


## Material Properties of Conductors

### Conductivity

Conductivity may be defined as $\sigma$ (sigma) where

$$
J = \sigma E
$$

The units of conductivity are $\frac{A}{V\cdot m}$.

### Resistivity

Resistivity $\rho$ (rho) is the inverse of conductivity

$$
\rho = \frac{1}{\sigma}
$$

whose units are $\frac{V\cdot m}{A}$.

## Ohm's Law

From the equation for conductivity may be derived the general form of **Ohm's Law**

$$
V = IR
$$

where $R=\frac{\rho L}{A}$. The units of $R$ are $\frac{V}{A}\equiv  \Omega$ or an Ohm.

## Power

Power is measured in Watts. The power supplied by a battery is equal to

$$
P = IV
$$

where $I$ is current and $V$ voltage.

### Power Dissipated in a Resistor

$$
P = I^2R
$$

## Drift Speed

Drift speed is equal to

$$
v_d = \frac{e\tau}{m}E
$$

where $\tau$ is the mean time between collisions.
