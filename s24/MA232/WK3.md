## Integrating Factorss

Given an equation of the form

$$
y'+p(x)y=f(x)
$$

we may define an integrating factor

$$
r=e^{\int p(x)\, dx}
$$

such that by multiplying each term on both sides of the equation, we derive a new equation

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left[y\cdot r(x) \right]=f(x)\cdot r(x)
$$

Integrating both sides yields

$$
y\cdot r(x)=\int{f(x)\cdot r(x)}
$$

which may then be solved to find a solution in terms of $y$.
