## Transient and Steady State Responses

The system response has two components, the steady state response $y_{ss}$ and the transient response $y_{tr}$ such that

$$
y(t) = y_{ss}(t)+y_{tr}(t)
$$

The transient response is present only immediately after the system is activated. In an asymptotically stable system,

$$
\lim_{t\rarr\infty}{y_{tr}(t)=0}
$$

however if the system is unstable the transient signal will increase very quickly.

## The Unit Impulse and Convolution

$$
x(t)\mathord{*}\delta(t)=x(t)
$$
