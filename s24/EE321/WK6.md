## Energy

The energy within an electric signal expressed by the function $f(x)$ may be expresseed as

$$
E_x = \int_{-\infin}^{\infin}{|f(x)|^2 dx}
$$

## Periodic Signals

For a signal $x(t)=x(t+T)$,
- $T$ is the period
- $f=\frac{1}{T}$ is the frequency
- $\omega = 2\pi f$ is the angular frequency
